Sister Princess games are unplanned, seem to be Tokimeki Memorial clones with nothing all that noteworty. Plenty of sister dating games exist so a chaste version isn't that interesting.... okay maybe a little bit. If you are a translator and want a game pushed thru the tooling process make an issue report. Currently focus is on (poorly) translating Summer Radish Vacation 1 and 2, then looking more into how Snow works. 

Next planned update is confirming repacking.
